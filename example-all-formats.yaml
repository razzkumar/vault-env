  # ===== PATH-BASED FORMATS (NEW) =====
  
  # 1. Load ALL keys from a path as environment variables
  # All keys become UPPERCASE env vars (e.g., db_password â†’ DB_PASSWORD)
  - path: myapp/config
  
  # 2. Load SINGLE key from path (key name becomes env var name)
  # Creates: DB_PASSWORD=secret123
  - path: myapp/config
    key: db_password
    
  # 3. Load SINGLE key from path with CUSTOM env var name
  # Creates: DATABASE_PASS=secret123 (instead of DB_PASSWORD)
  - path: myapp/config
    key: db_password
    env_key: DATABASE_PASS
  
  # ===== INDIVIDUAL FORMAT (OLD - still supported) =====
  
  # 4. Individual secret mapping (legacy format)
